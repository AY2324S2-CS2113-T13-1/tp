## Project: MathGenius

### Overview
MathGenius is a command-line application designed to generate math problem sets based on user-specified parameters. The application allows users to generate a set of math problems with various operators, number of problems, maximum digits, and length of operands. It also provides functionalities for checking the generated answers and displaying records.

### New Features
- Implemented the `Ui.java` class to handle user interface functionalities such as greeting, reading commands, displaying help messages, printing output, handling invalid inputs, and exiting the program.
- Developed the `Parser.java` class, which parses user commands and performs corresponding actions based on the command type.
- Collaborated with the team to create the overall UML and sequence diagrams to visualize the design and implementation of the application.

### Project management:  
Managed releases `v1.0` - `v2.1` (3 releases) on GitHub  

### Documentation
- User Guide (UserGuide.md):
    - Added documentation for the help function, providing clear instructions on how to use it to get information about other commands.
    - Reviewed and revised the entire guide to enhance readability. 
- Developer Guide (DeveloperGuide.md):
    - Reviewed, revised, and reformatted the entire guide to enhance readability and usability.

### Challenges
During the refinement process, I faced a few challenges, including:
- Striking a balance between providing sufficient detail and maintaining simplicity in the User Guide. It was essential to ensure that users can easily understand and follow the instructions without getting overwhelmed by technical details.
- Ensuring that the Developer's Guide covers all necessary information for developers without being too verbose or difficult to navigate. I aimed to provide a clear overview of the project structure and guidelines while keeping the guide concise and developer-friendly.
- Maintaining a study-life balance while working on the project. It was a challenge to manage my time effectively to meet project deadlines, keep up with my studies, and still have time for rest and recreation. The project workload is unexpected but **exciting**.

### Next Steps
Moving forward, the next steps for the project documentation are as follows:
- Continuously gather feedback from users and developers to identify areas that require further clarification or improvement.
- Regularly update the User Guide and Developer's Guide to reflect any changes or enhancements made to the MathGenius application.
- Collaborate with the team to maintain consistency and coherence across the documentation and address any emerging documentation needs.

### Community
- Reviewed other teams' TP and individual IP (with non-trivial review comments).
- Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class.
- Added milestones to keep track of the project's progress.
- Resolved issues, helped with bug fixing, and contributed to documenting and labeling the bugs.
