### ProblemGenerator Component
API: [ProblemGenerator.java](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/ProblemGenerator.java)

The `ProblemGenerator` component is designed to generate a set of math problems based on user-specified parameters. 

Users trigger the generator by entering a command in the following format:

    generate -t [operators] -n [number] -d [maximum digit] -l[length]
For example, a user might enter:

    generate -t +-*/ -n 10 -d 2 -l 3

#### Command Parsing
The `parseCommand()` function takes the user's command and extracts the parameters, which are then passed to the `generate()` function.

#### Problem Generation
The `generate()` function creates a single math problem by choosing three random operands (each with a maximum of two digits) and a random operation from the set of operators (+, -, *, /). This process is repeated the specified number of times to create a set of problems.

#### Default Options
If a user omits some parameters, the `defaultOptions()` function fills in the gaps with pre-set default options. The UI then prints a message for each missing parameter to inform the user.

#### Answer Calculation
The `Calculator` class calculates the answer to each problem during problem generation. The answer is then stored in the `Problem` class for later use.


### Checker Component  
**APIï¼š[Checker.java](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/Checker.java)**   

#### How `Checker` Works:
1. Each `Checker` instance is created with a `Test` class.
2. The `Checker` prompts for user input and compares the answer with a tolerance of up to `2` decimal places.
3. If the user input is not a number, the answer is automatically marked as incorrect.
4. The accuracy and the user's answers are stored for `UI` or other classes to access with specific functions.
5. The `Checker` also records the time taken by the user to solve the problem set.
6. The `Checker` stores the questions for which the user provided a wrong answer, as well as the incorrect answers.
    
#### Pseudo Code for Reference:

```
correct = 0
isCorrect = []
wrongProblem = []
wrongAnswer = []
for problem in problem set: 
    UI.PrintProblem
    answer <- user_input
    if answer - problem.answer < teleranceRange
        correct <- correct+1
        isCorrect.append("1")
    else
        isCorrect.append("0")
        wrongProblem.append(problem)
        wrongAnswer.append(userInput)
        continue
```
#### Future Enhancements for `Checker.java`:

1. Support checking more types of problems (e.g., Quadratic equations).
2. Providing explanations for the math problems.
3. Storing the answer in array format to handle function and matrix answers.

### Record Component

API: [Record.java](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/Record.java)

#### Design

The `Record` component is a snapshot of completed problem sets. It includes:

- Individual `Problem` instances
- The date the problem set was solved (`dateTime`)
- The time taken to solve the problem set (`speed`)
- The accuracy of the attempt (`accuracy`)

Each `Record` also stores the specifics of each `Problem` and a unique ID (created using Java's default `hashCode`) for organized or filtered viewing of past records.

Users can choose whether to display the problem set specifics or not using the `showProbDetails` parameter.

When writing a `Record` to an external file, it's written into a single line in the format of "`/dateTime(format:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) /speed /accuracy /problemSetID /problems`". For problems, each `Problem` is separated by a space and is formatted in "/problemDescription,/problemAnswer".

The unique ID for problem sets can be used in the `retry` command to uniquely locate any problem set for the users to retry a previous problem set.

#### Implementation

- Each `Record` object stores an `ArrayList` of `Problem` objects for storing specifics of the attempted Problem Set.

- When a problem set solving is saved to a `Record` **for the first time**, the corresponding `Record` object will create a unique ID for the problem set using Java's built-in `hashCode` method. When loading this `Record` in the future and re-saving the data, the same ID will be used, and no new IDs will be generated. This is achieved by using two different constructors for these two different situations.

- Another purpose for the two different constructors: the first one does not include a preset problem set ID as an argument. This is used when the problem set the users solved is done through the `generate` command. Each generated problem set will automatically be assigned a random hashcode as its ID. The second one does contain a problem set ID as an argument, and this is for when the user uses the `retry` command to retry a past problem set in the records. Thus, the new `Record` should use the same ID as the last, since it's the same problem set..

**Code Snippet**
```
// the two different constructors
public Record(LocalDateTime dateTime, double speed, double accuracy, ArrayList<Problem> probSet) {
   setSpeed(speed);
   setAccuracy(accuracy);
   setDateTime(dateTime);
   setProbSet(probSet);
   psIndex = probSet.hashCode();
}

public Record(LocalDateTime dateTime, double speed, double accuracy, ArrayList<Problem> probSet, int psIndex) {
   setSpeed(speed);
   setAccuracy(accuracy);
   setDateTime(dateTime);
   setProbSet(probSet);
   setPsIndex(psIndex);
}
```
### Storage Component

API: [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/Storage.java)

#### Design

The `Storage` Component:

- Reads / Writes to external files at appropriate runtime to enable data persistence throughout multiple usages of the software.
- Has a unique and strict format for external file formatting for proper loading data as well as input file corruption detection.
- Incorporates the `UI` and `Parser` components for proper user feedback regarding the save/load process.
- Stores a list of `Record` objects for reading/writing. Each `Record` is stored on a single, separate line. The formatting of each line is explained in the `Record` section.
- The `recordList` can be sorted by multiple parameters, including `dateTime`, `speed`, `accuracy`, and `problemSetID`. This is used by the `UI` component to display users' past records in any order they desire. 

#### Implementation

- Uses a list of `Record` objects to store all past attempts.
- Uses Java's built-in `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`, and `FileWriter` to write/read properly all information of all problem sets.
- `sortRecords` method sorts the `Record` list based on 4 different parameters(each representing sort by `datetime`, `speed`, `accuracy`, `problemSetID`). Each parameter has 3 different values: `0`, `1`, `2`. `0` means to not sort by this parameter, `1` means to sort(decreasing order), `2` means to sort in reverse(increasing order). These 4 parameters are determined by the user input, and interpreted by the `Parser` component.

### DIYProblemSet Component

The `DIYProblemSet` class is responsible for creating and managing a user-defined problem set. It allows users to input custom problems and their correct answers, and saves the problem set for future reference.

#### Class Signature
 ```
     public class DIYProblemSet {
        ArrayList<Problem> problemSet;
        
        public DIYProblemSet() {
            // Constructor logic
        }
        
        public void addDIYProblemSet(Ui ui) {
            // Method logic
        }
    }
```
#### Class Variables
```
    problemSet: An ArrayList of type Problem to store the user-defined problems.
```

#### Class Methods
    
```
    public DIYProblemSet()
```
  The constructor initializes the problemSet as a new ArrayList of Problem objects.

```
    public void addDIYProblemSet(Ui ui)
```

This method allows users to input their DIY problem set. It prompts for the problem description and correct answer, validates the input, and adds the problem to the `problemSet`. Once the user finishes adding problems, it creates a new `Record` object with the current timestamp, total correct answers set to 0, total time taken set to 0, the `problemSet`, and the problem set type as `USER_DIY`. It then saves the record using the `Storage.addRecord()` method and displays a success message along with the details of the saved problem set.

#### Method Flow

1. Create a new `Scanner` object to read user input.
2. Prompt the user to input their DIY problem set.
3. Inside a loop that continues until the user indicates they have finished adding problems:
   - Prompt the user to input the problem description.
   - Prompt the user to input the correct answer for the problem.
   - Validate the input by attempting to parse the correct answer as a `double`. If it fails, display an error message.
   - Create a new `Problem` object with the description and parsed answer, and add it to the `problemSet`.
   - Prompt the user to indicate if they have finished adding problems (`y` for yes, `n` for no).
   - Validate the input to ensure it is either `y` or `n`. If it is invalid, display an error message and prompt again.
4. Create a new `Record` object with the current timestamp, total correct answers set to `0`, total time taken set to `0`, the `problemSet`, and the problem set type as `USER_DIY`.
5. Save the record using the `Storage.addRecord()` method.
6. Display a success message indicating that the DIY problem set has been successfully saved.
7. Print the details of the saved problem set using the `record.print(true)` method.
8. Display a new line for formatting purposes.

### Testcase Component

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed test mechanism is facilitated by `ProblemGeneratorTest` and `CheckerTest`. These tests check the correctness of the generated problem sets' types, number of questions, and maximum digits, by comparing the generated output to the user input.

```
   ProblemGeneratorTest#operatorTest()â€‰â€”â€‰Test if the input operator type is align with the generated one.
   ProblemGeneratorTest#numberTest()â€‰â€”â€‰Test if the input number of questions is align with the generated number of questions.
   ProblemGeneratorTest#digitTest()â€‰â€”â€‰Test if the input max digits is align with the generated one.
   ProblemGeneratorTest#parseCommand()â€‰â€”â€‰parse the input command to fit in the program.
   ProblemGeneratorTest#parseNumber()â€‰â€”â€‰parse out the operands from a given problem.
```

Below is an example usage scenario and how the test behaves:

1. **Operator Test Case:**
   - The user launches the `ProblemGeneratorTest` and runs the operator test case.
   - The `ProblemGeneratorTest.operatorTest()` method loops through all the commands in the `commands` data member and allocates each command to its corresponding test case.
   - During this process, a `ProblemGenerator` instance (`pb`) is generated.
   - The problem sets generated by calling `ProblemGenerator.typeChoose()` are stored in the `test` variable.
   - The problem set is then extracted using `Test.getProblem()`.
   - For every problem in the generated problem set, `assertTrue` checks if the type of these problems matches the user input type.
   - If all problem types match, it successfully outputs the generated dataset. Otherwise, it outputs the problem with the incorrect format.

2. **Number Test Case:**
   - The user launches the `ProblemGeneratorTest` and runs the number test case.
   - The `ProblemGeneratorTest.numberTest()` method loops through all the commands in the `commands` data member.
   - It calls `ProblemGeneratorTest.parseCommand()` to parse the input command and get a hashmap with the input type, number, and digits information.
   - It generates a new `ProblemGenerator` instance and uses `ProblemGenerator.typeChoose()` to collect the generated problem.
   - It uses `assertEquals` to compare the user input number with the generated number of questions.

3. **Digit Test Case:**
   - The user launches the `ProblemGeneratorTest` and runs the digit test case.
   - The `ProblemGeneratorTest.digitTest()` method loops through all the commands in the `commands` data member.
   - It calls `ProblemGeneratorTest.parseCommand()` to parse the input command and get a hashmap with the input type, number, and digits information.
   - It generates a new `ProblemGenerator` instance and uses `ProblemGenerator.typeChoose()` to collect the generated problem.
   - For every problem, it calls `ProblemGeneratorTest.parseNumbers()` to extract the digits in the problem.
   - It uses `assertTrue` to verify if the input max digit is greater or equal to the digits of every operand in the generated problems.
