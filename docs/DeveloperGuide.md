## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}
* To be added

### Record Component - Design

API: ![Record.java](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/Record.java)

The Record component:

- a snapshot of a completed problem sets, including the individual problems, the date it was solved, the time taken to solve the problem set, and the accuracy of the attempt.
- \[Proposed\] records the specifics of each problem, including whether the answer is correct or not, for organized or filtered viewing of past records.

### Record Component - Implementation

- \[Proposed\] Store in each Record object a referential Test object for storing specifics of the attempted Problem Set.

### Storage Component - Design

API: ![Storage.java](../src/main/java/seedu/duke/Storage.java)

The Storage Component:

- Read / Write to external file at appropriate runtime to enable data persistence throughout multiple usages of the software.
- a unique and strict format for external file formatting for proper loading data as well as input file corruption detection.
- \[Proposed\] incorporate the UI, Parser component for proper user feedback regarding the save/load process

### Storage Component - Implementation

- Uses a list of Record objects to store all past attempts
- \[Proposed\] Use a hashing method to write / read properly all information of test object


## Product scope
### Target user profile

* The student who wish to practise their mathematical problem solving ability.  
* The teachers who wish to provide students with some math problems and check their performance.  

### Value proposition

The product automates the generation of mathematical problems and their corresponding answers, thereby reducing the effort required by students to find practice problems.
